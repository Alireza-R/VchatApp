VchatApp
========

voice chat client and server.

This is the first version of my voice chat system. In future versions, the bugs will be fixed and it should support SSL/TLS communications.

For using the codes, you need to install ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) SDK on Ubuntu. you can install it by: 
sudo apt-get install libasound-dev

We are working with PortAudio library to connect to the sound system. You need this library to run the program. You can find information about it on:
